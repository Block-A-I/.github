## Hi there 👋

🙋‍ We are the Team behind **Block A.I.** - an Discord Chat Bot based on discord.js using Brainshop AI
🌈 For now there is no way that the community could contribute to our projects
👩‍ Docs will be following soon aswell as an list of Commands and everything else!

You can see a full list of all our Team Members [here](https://blockai.infoblock.gq/team)
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
